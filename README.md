# Recoding_ColourComposition



## Pseudocode

There will be a loop to create the number of rosettes we want. Here there are 8, with different shapes and densities, so there will be random numbers to make them look different from each other.
We will fix with random numbers the position of the center of each rosette.
There will be another loop that goes up to a random number to have a different row density. Inside, we will draw lines from a certain distance from the center to a higher distance from the center. There may be a different distance interval for each of the rosettes.
We can observe rosettes with imperfections such as lines of inclination that must be taken into account but with a low probability of occurrence.
